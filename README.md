# coinmarketcap_data_collection (version 0.0.1)

The goal of this repo is to propose a collection of tools for collecting data from the coinmarketcap API with different programming languages (for now only python is proposed). Each program has one task and one task only : Collect the data and store it to a file. No data cleaning is done to don't loose any information and give the full dataset for any further analysis.

### List of scripts proposed :

* **coinmarketcap_collect_metadata.ipynb** : Python script to collect and store to a json file all the metadata for one or multiple coin(s) that are available on coinmarketcap. It's useful to get all the useful links and general information about a coin to start an analysis.
